# Setting up an open notebook using the Open Science Framework

#### ORCID

The Open Science Framework allows intergration with ORCID ID. ORCID 'provides a persistent digital identifier that distinguishes you from every other researcher and, through integration in key research workflows such as manuscript and grant submission, supports automated linkages between you and your professional activities ensuring that your work is recognized.'[^1]

You can register easily for an ORCID at [https://orcid.org/register]().

## Overview of the Open Science Framework

The Open Science Framework is a project of the Centre for Open Science with funding from a wide range of funders. The Open Science Framework aims to make Open Science easier for researchers by providing a platform for hosting, documentation, data, notebooks and linking to a range of other tools.

The Open Science Framework is a flexible tool which can be used across the whole research process or only for a single component of a project.


## Getting Started

### Explore existing notebooks

Exploring exisitng projects on the Open Science Framework may help to get a better idea of how the Open Science Framework can be used to make research more open. These suggested come from a range of disciplines and have used the Open Science Framework in different ways.


This project uses OSF to share underlying data and scripts for a published paper: Morís, Joaquín, Itxaso Barberia, Miguel A Vadillo, Ainhoa A Andrades, and Francisco J López. 2016. “Data and Scripts for ‘Slower Reacquisition after Partial Extinction in Human Contingency Learning.’” Open Science Framework. July 12. [osf.io/thrc6]().

This project shares data for a forthcoming paper: Read, Cassia F, Chiu Y C Ho, Matt D White, David H Duncan, and Peter A Vesk. 2017. “BRT Model Building (training) Data Set.” Open Science Framework. May 3. [osf.io/jndyv]().

- Kardas, Michael, Juliana Schroeder, and Nicholas Epley. 2017. “Humanizing Voice, Political Beliefs.” Open Science Framework. September 29. osf.io/nm8vf.
- IJzerman, Hans, Siegwart Lindenberg, İlker Dalğar, Michal Parzuchowski, Rodrigo Brito, Claudia Simao, Charles R Ebersole, et al. 2016. “The Human Penguin Project.” Open Science Framework. October 6. osf.io/2rm5b.

- Amon, Hanna, Molly Sterlacci, Åse Innes-Ker, and Anna, Ph.D. Kemdal Pho. 2015. “Do Swedish and American Subjects Exhibit Differences in Well-Being, Life Satisfaction and Emotion Regulation?” Open Science Framework. October 29. osf.io/d6rks.

## Setting up your own notebook
The following steps will help you setup an open notebook.

### Decide on a project
Notebooks can be organised in different ways depending on the type of research you carry out, what you want to use a notebook for and whether the notebook will be collobarative or not.

## Private or public?
The Open Science Framework allows you to choose whether to make your project (or componets) of a project public. One of reservtions people often have about open science and/or open notebooks is making available materials which they feel are not yet ready for public consumption.


## licensing your project
If you decide that you will make your notebook public, or you later decide to make it public, then it is important that it includes a license. A license will help ensure other people know under what terms they can use your work.

You can asign a standard license to your open notebook or upload a custom license. It is almost always preferable to use a standard license rather than develop a custom one. If your notebook is part of a funded research project then your funder may encourage (or require) a particular license. 

Sometimes you may want to use different licenses for different parts of your project for example:
- Software/code: MIT
- Data: CC0
- Documentaion, wikis, other outputs: CC-BY

You can find more information on licensing [http://help.osf.io/m/bestpractices/l/611430-licensing]().
