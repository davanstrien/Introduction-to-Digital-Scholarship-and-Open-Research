# Setting up a demo notebook using the Open Science Framework

## Overview of the Open Science Framework

The Open Science Framework is a project of the Centre for Open Science with funding from a wide range of funders. The Open Science Framework aims to make Open Science easier for researchers by providing a platform for hosting, documentation, data, notebooks and linking to a range of other tools.

The Open Science Framework is a flexible tool which can be used across the whole research process or only for a single component of a project.

## Getting Started


### Explore existing notebooks

Exploring exisitng projects on the Open Science Framework may help to get a better idea of how the Open Science Framework can be used to make research more open. These suggested come from a range of disciplines and have used the Open Science Framework in different ways.



This project uses OSF to share underlying data and scripts for a published paper: Morís, Joaquín, Itxaso Barberia, Miguel A Vadillo, Ainhoa A Andrades, and Francisco J López. 2016. “Data and Scripts for ‘Slower Reacquisition after Partial Extinction in Human Contingency Learning.’” Open Science Framework. July 12. [osf.io/thrc6]().

This project shares data for a forthcoming paper: Read, Cassia F, Chiu Y C Ho, Matt D White, David H Duncan, and Peter A Vesk. 2017. “BRT Model Building (training) Data Set.” Open Science Framework. May 3. [osf.io/jndyv]().

- Kardas, Michael, Juliana Schroeder, and Nicholas Epley. 2017. “Humanizing Voice, Political Beliefs.” Open Science Framework. September 29. osf.io/nm8vf.
