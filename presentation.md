## Open Science

> 'Open Science is the practice of science in such a way that others can collaborate and contribute, where research data, lab notes and other research processes are freely available, under terms that enable reuse, redistribution and reproduction of the research and its underlying data and methods.' - [Foster](https://www.fosteropenscience.eu/foster-taxonomy/open-science-definition)


## Digital Scholarship

> “Digital Scholarship” is defined as any scholarly activity that makes extensive use of one or more of the new possibilities for teaching and research opened up by the unique affordances of digital media. These include, but are not limited to, new forms of collaboration, new forms of publication, and new methods for visualizing and analyzing data. - Demystifying the Digital Humanities, University of Washington
