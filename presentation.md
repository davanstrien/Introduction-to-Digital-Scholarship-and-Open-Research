# Definitions

## Open Science

> 'Open Science is the practice of science in such a way that others can collaborate and contribute, where research data, lab notes and other research processes are freely available, under terms that enable reuse, redistribution and reproduction of the research and its underlying data and methods.' - [Foster](https://www.fosteropenscience.eu/foster-taxonomy/open-science-definition)


## Digital Scholarship

> “Digital Scholarship” is defined as any scholarly activity that makes extensive use of one or more of the new possibilities for teaching and research opened up by the unique affordances of digital media. These include, but are not limited to, new forms of collaboration, new forms of publication, and new methods for visualizing and analyzing data. - Demystifying the Digital Humanities, University of Washington

# Why?

---

# Paper based dissemination

- originally letters
- journal publishing
- one to one
- one to more

---

# Internet publishing

- dissemination now not constrained by physical copies
- costs of dissemination much lower
- potential for one - to - many dissemination

---

# Barriers to access

- open access publishing

---

# What's the point of open science?

- dissemination not the only issue:
  - reproducability
  - reuse of data
  - changing how research is done

---

# reproducability crisis?

- A couple of examples

# Excel fail

'Harvard University economists Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff have acknowledged making a spreadsheet calculation mistake in a 2010 research paper, “Growth in a Time of Debt” (PDF), which has been widely cited to justify budget-cutting. But the authors stand by their conclusion that higher government debt is associated with slower economic growth. Here’s what you need to know:'
