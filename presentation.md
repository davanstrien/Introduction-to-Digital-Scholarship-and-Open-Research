# Aim of session
- Introduce and offer motivations for open science/research
- Develop some ideas of how to implement Open Science/Research

# Definitions

## Open Science

> 'Open Science is the practice of science in such a way that others can collaborate and contribute, where research data, lab notes and other research processes are freely available, under terms that enable reuse, redistribution and reproduction of the research and its underlying data and methods.' - [Foster](https://www.fosteropenscience.eu/foster-taxonomy/open-science-definition)


## Digital Scholarship

> “Digital Scholarship” is defined as any scholarly activity that makes extensive use of one or more of the new possibilities for teaching and research opened up by the unique affordances of digital media. These include, but are not limited to, new forms of collaboration, new forms of publication, and new methods for visualizing and analyzing data. - Demystifying the Digital Humanities, University of Washington

> 'Making effective use of computers to do research' - Me

# Why?

---



things to include:

- Open Science
- Digital scholarship
- licensing (data and Software)
- Open Science Framework
- how to evaluate tools -> show some lists of tools - information overload. how to assess?
- incentives for open science/research AND 'traditional research'
- cultural and/or technical drivers


## intro

## definitions:
open science/research
digital scholarship

what are they?

### open science; aims/benefits
- improve effiecency discovery etc.
- reuse of existing data, code, methods, ideas
- economic benefits - industry adoption
- reproducability

---

# Science research (paper world)

- Publishing models
- greant -> research -> results -> publish

# implementing open science

"Open science is a means and not an ends. Open science strategies and policies are a means to support
better quality science, increased collaboration, and engagement between research and society that can lead to higher social and economic impacts of public research.
Open"

## technical/social challenges?

- incentive structures
- tools available.
- digital scholarship

## research lifecycle
- idealised model

### Easy wins
- ORCID ID
- licensing
- open notebook research?


## version control

## forking

## attribution

## Releasing/dissemination

## licensing

## open notebook research
- different models
- full documentation of research process
