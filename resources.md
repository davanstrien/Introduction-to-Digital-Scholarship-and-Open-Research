# Open Science

* The [Wikipedia Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science) for open science provides a useful overview of Open Science including different 'schools' of open science.  

* [Opening Science](http://book.openingscience.org/) The Evolving Guide on How the Web is Changing Research, Collaboration and Scholarly Publishing. Edited by SÃ¶nke Bartling & Sascha Friesike.

## Data Sharing and reuse

* An overview of funder policies on data sharing can be found on UCL's [Research Data Management page](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/library/research-support/research-data/policies/research-councils)

* [Working Open Workshop](http://mozillascience.github.io/working-open-workshop/) - a project from Mozila Science offereing guidance on data reuse. 

* A [checklist](http://mozillascience.github.io/checklist) on making data reusable from the [Working Open Workshop](http://mozillascience.github.io/working-open-workshop/). 

### Examples of good practice around data sharing

## Pre-registration

- The Centre for Open Science runs a ['pre-registration challenge'](https://cos.io/prereg) - 'Through our $1 Million Preregistration Challenge, we're giving away $1,000 to 1,000 researchers who preregister their projects before they publish them. It's straightforward to complete and will really enhance your research output.' 

- [The Preregistration Revolution](https://dx.doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/2DXU5) outlines the aims and benefits of pre-registration in more detail.
