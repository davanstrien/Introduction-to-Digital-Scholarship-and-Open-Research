# An Introduction to Digital Scholarship and Open Research

This repository collects workshop materials for a [course](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/hr/od/rdp/odid/) introducing digital scholarship and open research through Open Notebook research using the Open Science Framework as an example. 

The materials in this repository will be updated in preparation for each version of the course. 

## Slides

You can find slides on [Open Science and Digtial Scholarship](https://github.com/davanstrien/Introduction-to-Digital-Scholarship-and-Open-Research/blob/master/open-science-slides.pdf) and [Open Notebook Research](https://github.com/davanstrien/Introduction-to-Digital-Scholarship-and-Open-Research/blob/master/open-notebook-slides.pdf). 

The slides were produced using pandoc and Beamer using the [UCL Beamer Template](https://github.com/UCL/ucl-beamer) by Simon Byrne (based on the original template by Maurizio Filippone). 

TODO - Tidy slide source and output and create Makefile to produce slides from Markdown source.
