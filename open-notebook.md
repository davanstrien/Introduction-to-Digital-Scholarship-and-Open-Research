# Open notebook research?

> 'Open notebook science is the practice of making the entire primary record of a research project publicly available online as it is recorded. This involves placing the personal, or laboratory, notebook of the researcher online along with all raw and processed data, and any associated material, as this material is generated.' - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_notebook_science]().

# A blog?

- Narrative based notebooks
- Notebooks tracking day-to-day research activity

---

# More than a blog?

- Documentation
- Data sharing
- Code sharing
- Help facilate citizen science
- Can be intergated into existing research processes

---

# Disciplinary differences in approach

> - What is your 'data'
> - How do you work?
> - Teams or individual projects?

---

# How open?

> - You don't have to share everything
> - Consider what is useful for others
> - The intention to be open could help improve your research practices

---

# Components of an open notebook

> - Depends on the project
> - Depends on the aims behind your notebook
> - Reproducibility, citizen Science, collaboration tool?

---

# Using open notebooks to facilitate more open research

> - Open notebooks could be a good starting point for helping carry out more open research

> - Help with data sharing best practices
> - Documentaion
> - Faciliate colloboration

# Pre-registration

> 'Preregistration of an analysis plan is committing to analytic steps without advance knowledge of the research outcomes. That commitment is usually accomplished by posting the analysis plan to an independent registry such as http://clinicaltrials.gov/ or http://osf.io/. The registry preserves the preregistration and makes it discoverable, sometimes after an embargo period. With preregistration, prediction is achieved because selection of tests is not influenced by the observed data, and all conducted tests are knowable. The analysis plan provides constraint to specify how the data will be used to confront the research questions.' - https://dx.doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/2DXU5

# Preparing to share?

> - Organisation
> - Metadata
> - Documentaion
> - File formats

# Documentaion

## For your notebook
- What is your notebook for?

## For your teams
- Outline protocols
- Record progress
- Data Management Plan

## For other people  
- Explain your research process
- Develop guidance on using your data or code

---

# Licensing

A licence tells other people what they can do without having to ask you.

## Licesing publication
- Often defined by journal policies
- Your funder may require a particular licence

## Licensing data
- Do you have copyright over your data?
- Use a standard licence e.g. Creative Commons
- Community standards [Pollar Commons](http://www.polarcommons.org/ethics-and-norms-of-data-sharing.html)

## Licensing software
- Choose an existing license
- Does your software reuse code?

---

# Version control

Use some type of version control system for your data, code and other documentation.

## Manual approaches
- Systems for file naming e.g. 2017-10-07-documentation

## Automated version control
- [GitHub](https://github.com)
- Open notebooks
- Electronic lab notebooks

---

# Attribution


---

# Dissemination

- Use a persisent identifier (DOI)
- Cite data, software and other materials in publication
